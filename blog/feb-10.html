                        <strong> Foreword </strong>: The reason I am doing this is that recent events have brought a lot of stress to me and I thought this is a healthy way to relieve that tension. Also, please, no offence intended. I am really grateful to everyone here, particularly my parents and Khee. If were not for you guys, I would not be where I am today.

                    I feel compelled to explain myself after the announcement about my acceptance of Rakuten Ebates’ internship offer. While the salary is meager, I still feel quite grateful to have received the offer.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    One, excluding my internship last summer at a Palo Alto startup, where I was a data analytics person, I have next to zero experience in real-world/enterprise software development. I have written several software in the past few years, but none of which had brought value to any person in this world (check out <a href="http://pychat.pysim.me" target="_blank"> PyChat </a> though if you’d like to chat with an acquaintance). I see this as an opportunity to work with experienced engineers. I am quite excited to see how I would thrive in the real world.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Second, the project I will be working on involves search, machine learning and product recommendation (personalization), areas which I am quite interested in. 

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Third, this elaborates on the first point. I am mainly hoping this would serve as a stepping stone for me to get a full-time position at bigger, tech-first companies. I’d like to reiterate, the desire does not emanate from the eagerness to accumulate more money, though. It’s more about the opportunity of being part of a vibrant, intelligent community. After all, I will be more skilled after the summer and I hope the recruiters will take this into account when looking at my application. If I do perform well at Ebates, I should get a returning full-time offer between 80 and 90k.

                    Stepping foot on this foreign land a little more than 3 years ago, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I dreamed of going into the film industry (which made sense, after seven months of idleness plus plethora of Hong Kong TVB dramas and hey, Hollywood is nearby?!), but soon realized it was never my forte. I thought about becoming a liberal arts major, a Renaissance person, whose only focus was to acquire a wide-spectrum of knowledge, but was soon annoyed by the uncertainty in the academic pursuit of subjects like history would bring. Soon, I was urged to try out computer science and soon I went with the flow and became a engineering person. The logical and mathematical aspects of it remain challenging to me as of this writing, albeit intriguing.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    In retrospect, that was a sound advice and a correct decision as the era of artificial intelligence and automation will dawn on us, sooner rather than later. However, CS hasn’t been an easy journey for me. After all, it’s a math-intensive field and programming is only a very small part of it. I’d argue that I might be more comfortable (in achieving success) in any other field.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>

                    Over the past year, I have not had a moment of peace. The thought of not being able to secure a decent job upon graduation has never ceased to disappear and thus I'd be unable to repay my parents. They have worked hard for me, I have not worked as hard as I should have and for that, I am deeply sorry… 

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    However, in the past few years, I have grown and matured. I witnessed how my persistence was instrumental in getting me into UCSC’s physics and Cabrillo’s CS courses. If I hadn’t completed those courses, I would not have been able to transfer to Berkeley last year. And from this introspective writing, I have rediscover that doggedness that served me well in the past and I hope with that same doggedness, I will achieve my goal of securing my dream job.
